# Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Tina Nguyen 

## Description of Project 

After evaluating my user research and usage scenarios based off of my representative personas, I have come to the conclusion that my main goal of this app redesign should be to streamline and simplify the process of music discovery and user interaction on both the ends of the music consumer and the music creator. I have made some changes to the layout and functionality of the Audiu app and hope that with this low-fidelity prototyping, I can ensure that users are able to navigate the app with ease. 

## Tasks Supported 

* Ability to search through new music based on specific genres and save favorite songs 
* Ability to upload your own music 
* Ability to interact with other users through comments and messaging 

## Wireflow

## User testing 

Below is the result of the low-fidelity prototyping. Each color corresponds to a different task. 

* Red = searching through new music based on specific genres
* Purple = uploading your own music 
* Green = finding a song you like, favoriting it, commenting on it, and messaging its artist

## Reflection
latest tracks change name because it can be misleading 
what is phone library? album cover? 
differentiate between chat bubble/comment icon and mail icon on bottom bar 
make upvote icon more clear
how to go back from posting a comment back to song screen
