# Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Tina Nguyen 

## Description of Project 

After evaluating my user research and usage scenarios based off of my representative personas, I have come to the conclusion that my main goal of this app redesign should be to streamline and simplify the process of music discovery and user interaction on both the ends of the music consumer and the music creator. I have made some changes to the layout and functionality of the Audiu app and hope that with this low-fidelity prototyping, I can ensure that users are able to navigate the app with ease. 

## Tasks Supported 

* Ability to search through new music based on specific genres and save favorite songs 
* Ability to upload your own music 
* Ability to interact with other users through comments and messaging 

## Wireflow

## User testing 

Below is the result of the low-fidelity prototyping. Each color corresponds to a different task. 

* Red = searching through new music based on specific genres
* Purple = uploading your own music 
* Green = finding a song you like, favoriting it, commenting on it, and messaging its artist

## Reflection

Overall, I found this process to have went fairly smoothly. In putting together the wireframes, the only major issue I came across was figuring out where to draw each frame so that I can connect them smoothly to create a wireflow without there being too many overlapping arrows or arrows that span from one side of my page to the other. I found myself drawing upon the design of Spotify quite often because that was one app that was mentioned during my user research as a primary platform for listening to music. Having a reference made it a lot easier to map out the functionality of my app. 

In terms of the actual user testing, my participant was able to complete all three tasks sucessfully, although she did note a few areas of confusion. In the first task, I asked her to browse through songs sorted by the EDM genre and listen to the playlist on shuffle. She thought that the option being titled "Lastest Tracks" felt a bit misleading, but upon comparing it to the other avaible options, chose it because it made the most sense. Based on this, I am planning to change the title of this option to be something along the lines of "New Music" instead. 

In the second task, I asked my particpant to upload a song of theirs to the app. My original intention was for users to have the option of saving songs in the app's filing system and then choosing to publish them for the public at a later time or they could upload a song to the app directly from a file from their phone library. I thought this made sense at first, but my participant was confused by this and I now understand why. My participant went directly from "Import Tracks" to choosing one of the songs listed to upload, so she thought "Phone Library" meant your camera roll where you could choose an album cover. Based on this, I have decided to eliminate the extra step of navigating to your phone's library to upload a file and instead, combien the two options into one so that when you click on "Import Tracks," you are immediately redirected to your phone's library where you can then choose a song to upload then and there.  

In the third task, I asked my participant to find a song they liked, favorite it, comment on it, and message its artist. These related tasks were easily accomplished by my participant, although she did note that the chat bubble icon for the comment function being next to the envelope icon for the inbox function could be hard to differentiate between. She also noted that there was no back button to return to the previous page after completing a task. Based on this, I am planning on having text under each icon to describe what they are, as well as creating a back button that is a permanent fixture on the upper left hand corner so that users can easily navigate back to where they were before.
