# DH150 Assignment 02: Usability Testing by Tina Nguyen 

## Purpose of Usability Testing 

Usability testing is a means of gaining feedback from users on a product, such as an app or website. It allows the product designers to observe how users naturally interact with their product and test if their design was executed effectively. Usability testing reduces bias because it gives those who were not involved in the design process an opporunity to detect potential issues that may have been overlooked by desigers who have had continous exposure to the product and its issues.

Based on the findings of my heuristic evaluation, some areas of the app that needed the most improvement were the comment feature, the design of the profile page, and ability to connect with other users. Knowing this, I wanted to test whether or not other users who are not as familiar with the app also found similar issues with these areas as I did. 

Because the comment feature does not allow users to see what they are typing while they are typing it, I wanted to check if users found this to be a nuisance or if they did not mind not having a preview of the text before posting the comment. To test this, I will ask participants to post a comment on a track they liked. 

With the design of the profile page being very limited in functionality, I wanted to see if users found the minimal approach helpful in navigating the page, or if it brought about issues for the user. To test this, I will ask participants to change their display name through the "Edit Profile" function. 

I also found it difficult to connect with other users on the app, especailly artists whose work you enjoy, because the design of the app focuses more on featuring specific tracks as opposed to their creators. By asking participants to find an artist they enjoy and connect with them, I will see what steps users take in finding different user profiles.
