# DH150 Assignment 02: Audiu Usability Testing by Tina Nguyen 

## Purpose of Usability Testing 

Usability testing is a means of gaining feedback from users on a product, such as an app or website. It allows the product designers to observe how users naturally interact with their product and test if their design was executed effectively. Usability testing reduces bias because it gives those who were not involved in the design process an opporunity to detect potential issues that may have been overlooked by desigers who have had continous exposure to the product and its issues.

Based on the findings of my heuristic evaluation, some areas of the Audiu app that needed the most improvement were the comment feature, the design of the profile page, and ability to connect with other users. Knowing this, I wanted to test whether or not other users who are not as familiar with the app also found similar issues with these areas as I did. 

Because the comment feature does not allow users to see what they are typing while they are typing it, I wanted to check if users found this to be a nuisance or if they did not mind not having a preview of the text before posting the comment. To test this, I will ask participants to post a comment on a track they liked. 

With the design of the profile page being very limited in functionality, I wanted to see if users found the minimal approach helpful in navigating the page, or if it brought about issues for the user. To test this, I will ask participants to change their display name through the "Edit Profile" function. 

I also found it difficult to connect with other users on the app, especailly artists whose work you enjoy, because the design of the app focuses more on featuring specific tracks as opposed to their creators. By asking participants to find an artist they enjoy and connect with them, I will see what steps users take in finding different user profiles.

## Conclusion 

After conducting the pilot test, I found that many of the issues I found with the app were shared by the participant as well. However, there were some instances where the participant completed a part of a task in a way that was unintended. For example, when I asked the participant to navigate to an artist's profile and connect with them, instead of clicking on the artist's name, they clicked on the name of someone who commented on the artist's track. I had overlooked how these two features could have been mixed up, so the UT shed light on areas that proved to be confusing for users who are unfamiliar with the app. It was also extremely helpful to hear the participant talk through their actions and explain their thought process because it gave me a clearer understanding of how intuitive the app is to users. 

One thing I struggled with is how much detail I should give the participant when asking them to complete a task. I was unsure if I should just simply ask them to complete a task without further instruction, or if I should give them a step by step breakdown of how to complete a task. I think for this inital UT, it was fine to break down each task into different steps beacuse the particpant was new to the app and formatting the tasks this way tests user recognition of the different features. In the future, I will try giving less detail on how to complete each task to observe the different paths users take to complete a task.
