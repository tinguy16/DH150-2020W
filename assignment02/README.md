# DH150 Assignment 02: Usability Testing by Tina Nguyen 

## Purpose of Usability Testing 

Usability testing is a means of gaining feedback from users on a product, such as an app or website. It allows the product designers to observe how users naturally interact with their product and test if their design was executed effectively. Usability testing reduces bias because it gives those who were not involved in the design process an opporunity to detect potential issues that may have been overlooked by the desigers who have had continous exposure to the product.
