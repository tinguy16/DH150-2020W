# Audiu App Redesign: DH150 UX Design, Tina Nguyen

## Introduction
With my UX design, I hope to contribute to the community of up-and-coming artists as well as those who are seeking to discover new music. I hope to improve the UX/UI of the Audiu app in order to foster an environment where artists can share their music, receive feedback, and hopefully gain new fans. Through my redesign of the app, it is my goal to create a space that is conducive to interactional communication rather than just transactional communication.

## Design statement 
While the Audiu app is currently marketed as an app that can be used by both music consumers and music creators to broaden their musical horizons and enhance their overall music consuming and creating experience, the design of the app fails to create a sense of community that allows for a back and forth exchange of thoughts and ideas between users. With my app redesign, I hope to address this design challenge and add features that are conducive to community building and open conversation between users who wish to discover new music and users who would like to hear feedback about the music they've created. My goal is to turn first time listeners into lifelong followers of an artist as well as to give up and coming artists an outlet with which they can grow their career through exposure and constructive criticism. This would fulfill esteem needs for users at both ends of the musical spectrum. Music consumers would feel like they are valued by music creators for their feedback and support while music creators would feel like they are respected by those who enjoy their music.

## Competitor analysis
### Heuristic Evaluation
In order to improve upon the Audiu app, I wanted to first compare it to a more well established competitor, SoundCloud.

### Usability Testing
I also conducted a usability test on the Audiu app to observe and evalutate how others interact with the app and what problems they may come accross.

## User research
The Audiu app is desgined for users from the teenage years to young adult years who have begun to form an idea of who they are as a person and their likes/dislikes, but are still open to exploring options outside their comfort zone. These users enjoy either listening to music, creating music, or both. While they do appreciate mainstream music, they are looking to expose themselves to new sounds and artists. Users may also be amateur artists who are trying to make themselves known, but do not have the resources to do so. 

In order to gain a better understanding of the target market and what their needs are, I conducted an interview with an individual who fits within the target user description.

## UX storytelling 
I've created three different personas and respective scenarios to represent the types of users that would ideally interact with the Audiu app and the tasks they are looking to accomplish.
