# Audiu App Redesign: DH150 UX Design, Tina Nguyen

## Introduction
With my UX design, I hope to contribute to the community of up-and-coming artists as well as those who are seeking to discover new music. I hope to improve the UX/UI of the Audiu app in order to foster an environment where artists can share their music, receive feedback, and hopefully gain new fans. Through my redesign of the app, it is my goal to create a space that is conducive to interactional communication rather than just transactional communication.

## Design statement 
While the Audiu app is currently marketed as an app that can be used by both music consumers and music creators to broaden their musical horizons and enhance their overall music consuming and creating experience, the design of the app fails to create a sense of community that allows for a back and forth exchange of thoughts and ideas between users. With my app redesign, I hope to address this design challenge and add features that are conducive to community building and open conversation between users who wish to discover new music and users who would like to hear feedback about the music they've created. My goal is to turn first time listeners into lifelong followers of an artist as well as to give up and coming artists an outlet with which they can grow their career through exposure and constructive criticism. This would fulfill esteem needs for users at both ends of the musical spectrum. Music consumers would feel like they are valued by music creators for their feedback and support while music creators would feel like they are respected by those who enjoy their music. I also hope to improve upon the ease of use of the app by streamlining the processes for discovering and sharing new music.  

## Competitor analysis
### Heuristic Evaluation
In order to improve upon the Audiu app, I wanted to first compare it to a more well established competitor, SoundCloud. In comparison to SoundCloud, I found that Audiu's aesthetic to be more dated. I also found that Audiu was missing some essential elements, such as an activity feed, a "Compose message" option, and a "Favorited tracks" list. The way comments are displayed is also very limiting.

### Usability Testing
I also conducted a usability test on the Audiu app to observe and evalutate how others interact with the app and what problems they may come accross. I found that some of the features of the app can easily be mistaken for one another, causing confusion for the user as to which it the correct option for the task they are tying to complete.

## User research
The Audiu app is desgined for users from the teenage years to young adult years who have begun to form an idea of who they are as a person and their likes/dislikes, but are still open to exploring options outside their comfort zone. These users enjoy either listening to music, creating music, or both. While they do appreciate mainstream music, they are looking to expose themselves to new sounds and artists. Users may also be amateur artists who are trying to make themselves known, but do not have the resources to do so. 

In order to gain a better understanding of the target market and what their needs are, I conducted an interview with an individual who fits within the target user description. I found that the use of curated playlists was an important aspect to the user's experience. The user enjoyed both playlists that had a mix of genres as well as playlists that contained songs that are similar to the ones she already likes. The user also expressed that she liked the organizational aspect of playlists, but she would like it if the app organized her songs within her playlists for her (i.e. by genre). In analyzing the way in which the user went about finding new music, I found that she took a very network-oriented appraoch, where she'd start with one trusted source (i.e. her friends or an artist she likes) and from there find other similar songs/artists and just move along this interconnected network that never really took her beyond what she was already vaguely familiar with. The user, however, expressed that this could be very time consuming and overwhelming. [Read more...](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment04)

## UX storytelling 
I've created three different personas and respective scenarios to represent the types of users that would ideally interact with the Audiu app and the tasks they are looking to accomplish. 

### 1. Abby

Abby | Empathy Map 
-----|-----------
![Abby](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/raw/master/abby.jpg)|![EmpathyMap](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/raw/master/abby%20EM.jpg)

**Age:** 20

**Gender:** Female

**Occupation:** College student 

**Location:** New York

**Characteristics:** explorative, outgoing, friendly 

**Motivation/Needs:** Abby is an avid music listener. She primarily listens to music through Spotify, but is not completely satisfied with this platform. Because she is listening to music from the moment she wakes up til the moment she goes to sleep, she often finds herself listening to the same songs and artists. Abby wants to find a way to explore new music, but doesn't know where to begin her search. She is tired of the same mainstream music she hears everywhere and wants to try listenng to more undiscovered artists. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** Abby is fairly technically literate, but prefers to stick to apps with design features she is familiar with. That being said, she spends most of her time on social media, so she would like the music streaming platform
she uses to have similar features to those of Instagram or Facebook. She can get impatient at times, so having to endlessly
scroll or click too many times before getting to her desired destination will cause her to just give up. 

### Scenario 1
**Intention/goal:** It's a Saturday morning and Abby decides to kick off her weekend by going to work out at the gym. When she gets there, she hears the speakers in the gym playing the same Top 40 hits they play every week, so she decideds to pop in her AirPods to listen to her own music. She's three songs into her workout playlist on Spotify when she starts getting bored of her own playlist. She hasn't had time to curate a new workout playlist, so she's been listening to this same rotation of songs every time she goes to work out. She then tries looking through Spotify's Discover playlist, but this is just a mix of different types of music and Abby specifically wants to listen to EDM while working out to get her pumped up. Abby wants to find a way to listen to new music from new artists while also being able to customize her experience to her music preferences.

**Action:** Abby decides to open up the Audiu app in hopes that it will provide her with fresh new music. She taps on "Latest Tracks" and filters the results to show only EDM music. Once the filter has been applied, she is left with a tracklist of EDM songs from varrious undiscovered aristst. She decides to shuffle the playlist and let it play as she works out. While listening, Abby comes across a few songs that she expecially enjoys, so she taps on the "favorite" icon to add these songs to her library. Abby finishes her workout with the motivation to do so coming from all the new music she discovered and is excited to replay those favorited songs on her drive home.

**Age:** 24

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:** Waiter/aspiring musician 

**Location:** Los Angeles

**Characteristics:** shy, hard working, passionate 

**Motivation/Needs:** Eric just moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. Unfortunately, it's been hard for him to get his music heard with all of the surrounding competition, but he is determined to find a way to get his name out there. Coming from a small town, Eric is relatively shy, so interacting with people by street performing is not his strongest suit. Instead, he hopes to find a platform that will allow him to post his music and form a following virtually. Eric has tried posting his music on social media sites like YouTube, but there is just too much unrelated content on there for others to ever come across his music. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** Eric understands the the basics of technology, but going beyond that can be overwhelming for him. He is not looking for anything fancy, he simply wants to be able to upload his music, view fan engagement, and interact with other users via comments and messages.

### Scenario 2
**Intention/goal:** It's been two months since Eric posted his newest song on YouTube and Spotify. He's been checking back everyday to see how many people have viewed/streamed it, but has constantly been disappointed with what he's found. His YouTube video has only been viewed 50 times with a mere 3 comments, and his Spotify single has only been streamed 80 times with no option for users to comment their thoughts on it. Eric is feeling a bit discouraged and intimidated having to post his music up alongside viral hits that garner all the attention, so he wants to find a platform where he is more likely to get discovered as well as a place where he can easily interact with his new fans. 

**Action:** Eric opens up Audiu on his phone and decides to see how much success his song can reach on there. He taps on the "Import tracks" option, chooses the audio file from his phone's library, and hits upload. Within a few minutes, the song is uploaded to Eric's profile and available for the public to listen to. After only a few days, Eric checks back and to his pleasant surprise, he sees that his song has already been played 300 times and commented on 60 times. Eric eagerly hits reply on each comment, types his response to all of the support, and publishes his comments. Eric begins to feel hopeful again of his career in music.

### 3. Richie

**Age:** 25

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:** Music teacher 

**Location:** Chicago  

**Characteristics:** caring, patient, empathetic 

**Motivation/Needs:** As a music teacher for 4 years, Richie has a passion for helping others develop their musical abilities.
He has worked with people of all ages and skill levels and considers himself an expert musician and mentor. Although Richie normally charges for his music lessons, he wants to continue helping other aspiring musicians outside of his workplace for free and in a more casual setting. He doesn't want to sign up for anything that is too much commitment. He just wants to be able to give his comments and critiques to others whenever he pleases. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** One of Richie's main issues with apps is that their design looks too dated. Richie prefers using apps that are aesthetically pleasing. He enjoys modern, minimal designs that are not too distracting but still have a visual appeal to them. 

### Scenario 3
**Intention/goal:** After a long week of teaching classes at the local music academy, Richie is sitting in his living room on a Saturday afternoon thinking about what more he can do to help out his community. He recognizes that the music academy he works at is fairly competitive to get into and not to mention extremely costly. Richie knows that his expertise is in music and wants to extend his mentoring skills beyond the classroom to help serve those who do not have the resources to obtain formal guidance from a trained professional. However, he also knows that with his busy teaching schedule, he does not have a lot of free time to volunteer at a nonprofit music organization or actively seek out those who might need his help. Richie hopes to find an online platform used by many up and coming artists where he can casually engage in open conversation with them and help them to improve. 

**Action:** Richie comes across the Audiu app and after downloading it, navigates to the "Latest Tracks" option where he then shuffles through some of the songs until he finds one that resonates with him. Because he has a lot of advice to give the artist, instead of just leaving a comment on the track, Richie decides to tap on the artist's username to get him to the artist's profile and connects with the artist. He then sends the artist a message introducing himself and offering his constructive criticism. This begins a back and forth conversation between Richie and the artist which ends in Richie feeling fulfilled and good about himself.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
This sketch showcases the processes for searching through new music based on specific genres and saving favorite songs, uploading your own music, and interacting with other users through comments and messaging. [Read more...](hhttps://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment06)

## Low-fidelity prototype 
Below is the result of the low-fidelity prototyping. Each color corresponds to a different task.
* Red = searching through new music based on specific genres
* Purple = uploading your own music
* Green = finding a song you like, favoriting it, commenting on it, and messaging its artist

My participant was able to complete all three tasks sucessfully, although she did note a few areas of confusion. In the first task, I asked her to browse through songs sorted by the EDM genre and listen to the playlist on shuffle. She thought that the option being titled "Lastest Tracks" felt a bit misleading, but upon comparing it to the other avaible options, chose it because it made the most sense. In the second task, I asked my particpant to upload a song of theirs to the app. My participant went directly from "Import Tracks" to choosing one of the songs listed to upload, so she thought "Phone Library" meant your camera roll where you could choose an album cover. In the third task, I asked my participant to find a song they liked, favorite it, comment on it, and message its artist. These related tasks were easily accomplished by my participant, although she did note that the chat bubble icon for the comment function being next to the envelope icon for the inbox function could be hard to differentiate between. She also noted that there was no back button to return to the previous page after completing a task. [Read more...](hhttps://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment06)

## High-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to transform the previously made wireflow into an interactive prototype of the Audiu app in hopes of improving upon the original app. In order to create this high fidelity prototype, I reflected upon past user tests to improve upon my original wireflow's design. I also referenced Spotify's and Instagram's user interfaces because I felt like they were well designed and have features that I was looking to incorporate into my app redesign. I used InVision Studio to create the final product shown below. [Read more...](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/tree/master/assignment086)
