# Audiu App Redesign: DH150 UX Design, Tina Nguyen

## Introduction
With my UX design, I hope to contribute to the community of up-and-coming artists as well as those who are seeking to discover new music. I hope to improve the UX/UI of the Audiu app in order to foster an environment where artists can share their music, receive feedback, and hopefully gain new fans. Through my redesign of the app, it is my goal to create a space that is conducive to interactional communication rather than just transactional communication.

## Design statement 
Upon first using the app, I found the aesthetics of it to be a bit dated. However, the design is simple enough that navigating through the app was pretty intuitive. I felt like there were some elements missing, such as an activity feed, a "Compose message" option, and a "Favorited tracks" list. The way comments are displayed is also very limiting. I found that the design makes it difficult to meaningfully interact with other users.
