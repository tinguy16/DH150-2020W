<h1>Audiu/SoundCloud App Redesign

<h2>DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Tina Nguyen

<h3>Descripton of Community: 
  
  With my UX design, I hope to contribute to the community of up-and-coming artists as well as those who are seeking to discover new music. I hope to improve the UX/UI of the Audiu or SoundCloud app in order to foster an environment where artists can share their music, receive feedback, and hopefully gain new fans. Through my redesign of the app, it is my goal to create a space that is conducive to interactional communication rather than just transactional communication.

  <h4>Overview: 
  
  Audiu is an audio hosting platform that allows undiscovered artists to share their music and receive feedback from other users. Users can upload their own tracks, discover new tracks based on desired genre, and rate, favorite, and comment on tracks. 
  
  <h4>Overall evaluation: 
  
  Upon first using the app, I found the aesthetics of it to be a bit dated. However, the design is simple enough that navigating through the app was pretty intuitive. I felt like there were some elements missing, such as an activity feed, a "Compose message" option, and a "Favorited tracks" list. The way comments are displayed is also very limiting. I found that the design makes it difficult to meaningfully interact with other users. 


<h2>Heuristic evaluation:

<h4>#1: Visibility of system status
  
There is a loading symbol when the user clicks on the different menu feautures and waits for them to open or when the user submits a comments and waits for it to post. There is also a progress bar that shows how far into a track the user is. 

Severity rating: 1

<h4>#2: Match between system and the real world
  
The app uses the symbols for profile, inbox, settings, comment, like/favorite, like/dislike, and notifications that are commonly used. It also uses the play/pause icons to control the music, which are also used in offline music listening. 

Severity rating: 1

<h4>#3: User control and freedom
  
There is a back button to allow users to go back if they accidently presssed on a menu item they did not intend to. However, there is no option to undo sending a message or comment. 

Severity rating: 2

<h4>#4: Consistency and standards
  
While the icons that are used are consistent throughout the app, there is sometimes a "home" option to take the user back to the home page while other times there is not and there is only a back arrow to take the user back to the previous page they were on. The "feedback stream" and "latest tracks" options on the menu also seem to perform the same function. When pressing the pause button to pause the music, the music sometimes will still continue to play. 

Severity rating: 3

<h4>#5: Error prevention
  
When composing a comment or message, the user is unable to see the text as they're typing, so they have no way to prevent any errors in the text before they post or send it. 

Severity rating: 3

<h4>#6: Recognition rather than recall
  
The app provides different menu options for the user, rather than asking the user to manually input what they want. 

Severity rating: 1

<h4>#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
  
There is no way for users to customize their menu options or search for a specific user or track. 

Severity rating: 2

<h4>#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
  
The design is simple and easy to navigate. However, the aesthetics of it is not very appealing and could be more modern. 

Severity rating: 2

<h4>#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
  
While an error message does pop up when the user attempts to connect their Soundcloud account to the app, there is no explanation of how to fix this error. 

Severity rating: 2

<h4>#10: Help and documentation
  
Although there is an option to contact support via email, there should also be a FAQ page to get immediate answers to common questions. Only the "feedback stream" has a "what's this?" option to clarify its purpose. This option should be available on all the menu options as well. 

Severity rating: 2

  <h4>URL: 
  
https://soundcloud.com/
  
  <h4>Overview: 
  
  SoundCloud is an app that hosts music from both up-and-coming as well as well-known artists. Users can stream original tracks and remixed tracks on the app. SoundCloud allows users to like and comment on tracks as well as follow their favorite artists. 
  
  <h4>Overall evaluation: 
  
 I feel like the design of this app could be more simplified. While the functionality is straightforward, the home page is a bit cluttered and it can take a while to scroll to a specific feature. I think overall, there are too many options that make the app confusing to navigate for new users. It was also difficult to use from the artist side i.e. uploading music. However, aesthetically I think the design of the app is very sleek and visually appealing. 


<h2>Heuristic evaluation:

<h4>#1: Visibility of system status
  
As a song is playing, the user is able to see how far along in the song they are by looking at the progress bar. When the user clicks on the favorite or reposst button, it changes color to let the user know the action has been completed. When posting a comment, there is also a loading symbol that appears while the user waits for their comment to successfully post. 

Severity rating: 1

<h4>#2: Match between system and the real world
  
The home, search, favorite, repost, and activity feed symbols are all commonly used symbols that resemble their real world counterpart. However, the symbol used to get to the user's profile is more obscure and not as intuitive. 

Severity rating: 1 

<h4>#3: User control and freedom
  
If the user presses and holds a comment they posted, they are able to delete the comment. The back button and home button are also constantly present for the user to exit out of an action or go back to a previous action. 

Severity rating: 1

<h4>#4: Consistency and standards
  
There is a toolbar at the bottom of the app that allows users to quickly and easily navigate to the main pages of the app. This toolbar is present throughout the use of the app and its function remains contant. While there is usually a back button on the upper left hand corner, when a track is playing, this button disappears and there is instead a down button on the upper right hand corner that performs the same function. It is also hard to understand the difference between the "SoundCloud Weekly" page and the "More of what you like page" since they both seem to be curated based on the user's listening history. In order to access their following page and profile, the user must look under the Library page, which is unconventional.
