# Assignment 05: Persona + Scenario by Tina Nguyen
## Personas
### 1. Abby

![Abby](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/blob/master/abby.jpg)

**Age:** 20

**Gender:** Female

**Occupation:** College student 

**Location:** New York

**Characteristics:** explorative, outgoing, friendly 

**Motivation/Needs:** Abby is an avid music listener. She primarily listens to music through Spotify, but is not completely satisfied with this platform. Because she is listening to music from the moment she wakes up til the moment she goes to sleep, she often finds herself listening to the same songs and artists. Abby wants to find a way to explore new music, but doesn't know where to begin her search. She is tired of the same mainstream music she hears everywhere and wants to try listenng to more undiscovered artists. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** Abby is fairly technically literate, but prefers to stick to apps with design features she is familiar with. That being said, she spends most of her time on social media, so she would like the music streaming platform
she uses to have similar features to those of Instagram or Facebook. She can get impatient at times, so having to endlessly
scroll or click too many times before getting to her desired destination will cause her to just give up.

### 2. Eric

![Eric](https://github.com/tinguy16/DH150-2020W/blob/master/eric.jpg)

**Age:** 24

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:** Waiter/aspiring musician 

**Location:** Los Angeles

**Characteristics:** shy, hard working, passionate 

**Motivation/Needs:** Eric just moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. Unfortunately, it's been hard for him to get his music heard with all of the surrounding competition, but he is determined to find a way to get his name out there. Coming from a small town, Eric is relatively shy, so interacting with people by street performing is not his strongest suit. Instead, he hopes to find a platform that will allow him to post his music and form a following virtually. Eric has tried posting his music on social media sites like YouTube, but there is just too much unrelated content on there for others to ever come across his music. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** Eric understands the the basics of technology, but going beyond that can be overwhelming for him. He is not looking for anything fancy, he simply wants to be able to upload his music, view fan engagement, and interact with other users via comments and messages.

**Age:** 25

**Gender:** Male

**Occupation:** Music teacher 

**Location:** Chicago  

**Characteristics:** caring, patient, empathetic 

**Motivation/Needs:** As a music teacher for 4 years, Richie has a passion for helping others develop their musical abilities.
He has worked with people of all ages and skill levels and considers himself an expert musician and mentor. Although Richie normally charges for his music lessons, he wants to continue helping other aspiring musicians outside of his workplace for free and in a more casual setting. He doesn't want to sign up for anything that is too much commitment. He just wants to be able to give his comments and critiques to others whenever he pleases. 

**Barriers/Facilitators:** One of Richie's main issues with apps is that their design looks too dated. Richie prefers using apps that are aesthetically pleasing. He enjoys modern, minimal designs that are not too distracting but still have a visual appeal to them.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1
**Intention/goal:** It's a Saturday morning and Abby decides to kick off her weekend by going to work out at the gym. When she gets there, she hears the speakers in the gym playing the same Top 40 hits they play every week, so she decideds to pop in her AirPods to listen to her own music. She's three songs into her workout playlist on Spotify when she starts getting bored of her own playlist. She hasn't had time to curate a new workout playlist, so she's been listening to this same rotation of songs every time she goes to work out. She then tries looking through Spotify's Discover playlist, but this is just a mix of different types of music and Abby specifically wants to listen to EDM while working out to get her pumped up. 

**Action:** Abby decides to open up the Audiu app in hopes that it will provide her with fresh new music. She taps on "Latest Tracks" and filters the results to show only EDM music. Once the filter has been applied, she is left with a tracklist of EDM songs from varrious undiscovered aristst. She decides to shuffle the playlist and let it play as she works out. While listening, Abby comes across a few songs that she expecially enjoys, so she taps on the "favorite" icon to add these songs to her library. Abby finishes her workout with the motivation to do so coming from all the new music she discovered and is excited to replay those favorited songs on her drive home.

### Scenario 2
**Intention/goal:** It's been two months since Eric posted his newest song on YouTube and Spotify. He's been checking back everyday to see how many people have viewed/streamed it, but has constantly been disappointed with what he's found. His YouTube video has only been viewed 50 times with a mere 3 comments, and his Spotify single has only been streamed 80 times with no option for users to comment their thoughts on it. Eric is feeling a bit discouraged and intimidated having to post his music up alongside viral hits that garner all the attention. 

**Action:** Eric opens up Audiu on his phone and decides to see how much success his song can reach on there. He taps on the "Import tracks" option, chooses the audio file from his phone's library, and hits upload. Within a few minutes, the song is uploaded to Eric's profile and available for the public to listen to. After only a few days, Eric checks back and to his pleasant surprise, he sees that his song has already been played 300 times and commented on 60 times. Eric eagerly hits reply on each comment, types his response to all of the support, and publishes his comments. Eric begins to feel hopeful again of his career in music.

### Scenario 3
**Intention/goal:** After a long week of teaching classes at the local music academy, Richie is sitting in his living room on a Saturday afternoon thinking about what more he can do to help out his community. He recognizes that the music academy he works at is fairly competitive to get into and not to mention extremely costly. Richie knows that his expertise is in music and wants to extend his mentoring skills beyond the classroom to help serve those who do not have the resources to obtain formal guidance from a trained professional. However, he also knows that with his busy teaching schedule, he does not have a lot of free time to volunteer at a nonprofit music organization or actively seek out those who might need his help.
